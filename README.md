Hey, I'm will, I'm a University student studying computer science.

Just looking for interesting people to collaborate with to create some promising projects, honestly pretty much down to experiment with anything
from executables to command line applications or websites.

Languages:
- C
- Lua
- Python
- C#
- C++

( Concatenated into a top to bottom table in order of fluency, the last 2 still most definately being a work in progress lol )
